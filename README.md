  <h1>
  Hello, I'm Anuraag! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

I'm a passionate computer engineering student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, with a knack for tackling complex problems with innovative solutions. My coding arsenal includes Python, Java, and C++, and I have a track record of working on diverse projects. I've ventured into creating my own compiled language, crafted an interactive sudoku solver, and even contributed public tests and solutions for a challenging C++ class.

Beyond coding, I'm an enthusiast of diverse hobbies, whether I'm coaxing melodies from my cello ðŸŽ», exploring the great outdoors through hiking ðŸ¥¾, playing in pool tournaments ðŸŽ± or diving into a good book. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow.

In my spare time, I took on a unique project â€“ a Canvas Discord bot designed to help engineering students collaborate on assignments and stay organized. This bot proved to be a big success, serving over 100 students in their academic journeys.

What sets me apart is not just my skills but my strong work ethic and willingness to learn. I thrive in collaborative environments and am confident that my passion and expertise can contribute to the success of any team.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. Let's code the future together! ðŸš€
