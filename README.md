  Hello, I'm Anuraag! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

I love coding, building solutions to difficult problems, typing, playing pool, and I especially enjoy pushing my boundaries in terms of my capabilities and problem solving abilities. I mostly work in Python and TypeScript, but I have experience in a lot of other languages as well (from doing advent of code challenges each year). Some of my most notable projects: 

- ** Canvas Discord Bot ** - A discord bot that helps students connect in engineering classes. They can ask questions on a forum, send assignment reminders, schedule to-do tasks. This was actually used by people in classes and helped a lot of people understand the material.
- ** GeoGuessr AI ** - Using a ResNet based model, it is possible to predict where a location is in the US based on just one image retrieved from the Street View API. My solution managed to guess 500 miles away from the actual location, but a more improved version is coming soon. 

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. Let's build something awesome! ðŸš€
