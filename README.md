  hi, i'm anuraag! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

recently, i've been researching machine learning a lot (mostly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's youtube series) and learning C#. hoping for a super productive summer! 

## summer goals
 
 - finish a general purpose reinfocement learning implementation for most games using a DQN + CNN/LSTM combination. read the code [here](https://github.com/boopdotpng/machine-learning-hw-uncc/tree/main/final-rl).
 - overhaul my personal website (visit [here](https://anuraagw.me)) 
 - try to contribute something to tinygrad (and maybe get a bounty!)

## some of my past work

 - a geoguessr AI that is reasonably good at predicting locations in the US. this could use some improvements as well. perhaps a resnet based model would work better. 
 - started writing my own compiler (in rust) for booplang (work in progress). this is a super ambitious goal and i got stuck midway through working on it but i want to come back to it soon. [link](https://github.com/boopdotpng/booplang)
 - wrote embedded software (in python) on a raspberry pi for a machine built to rewarm vitrified organoids. specially controlled heating, motors, a custom menu system for a lcd char display, and much more. [link](https://github.com/boopdotpng/senior-design-23to24)

# misc goals 
- get really good at geoguessr. shoutout zi8gzag!
- follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/boopdotpng)! 
- type faster than 160wpm consistently. (currently at 120 ish in real world typing)
